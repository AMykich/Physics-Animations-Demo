# Android Physics Animations
With the introduction of material design, Android adopted a design language that is grounded in reality. Surfaces, edges, and shadows all work together to provide visual cues users will instinctively recognize and understand. Now, Google is releasing a new set of APIs to do the same thing for Android animations.

The new physics-based animation APIs use the laws of physics to create motion that matches the real world. These animations are driven by forces such as velocity, friction, stiffness, and more. The APIs make it easy to define these properties and create realistic motion that can be applied to just about any property of a View.
